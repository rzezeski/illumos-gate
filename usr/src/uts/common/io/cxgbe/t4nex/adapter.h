 * These are the Egress Queue doorbell methods. They are listed in order of

 * provided to allow kernel-bypass network stacks. However, they can also be
 * used in the kernel and provide benefits such as write combining and per-queue
 * registers (versus KDB which is a single register).
 *
 * The WCWR, Write Combining Work Request, is the preferred method. It allows
 * the driver to push a WR directly to the device without the need for it to
 * perform a DMA read of the hardware ring (to read the EQ host credit). Instead
 * it comes in via the BAR2/UDB memory space and the device increments the pidx
 * accordingly. However, the WCWR is limited to a single WR. It's use is
 * intended for low latency situations or low rate of work, not for throughput.
 *
 * The maximum WCWR for T4 is 256 bytes. For T5/T6 it is 64-128 bytes, depending
 * on the write-combining size of the platform.
