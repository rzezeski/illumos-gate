 * MAC data path
 *
 * The MAC data path is concerned with the flow of traffic from mac clients --
 * DLS, IP, etc. -- to various GLDv3 device drivers -- e1000g, vnic, aggr,
 * ixgbe, etc. -- and from the GLDv3 device drivers back to clients.
 *
 * -----------
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 *
 * MAC uses a lot of different, but related terms that are associated with the
 * design and structure of the data path. Before we cover other aspects, first
 * let's review the terminology that MAC uses.
 *
 * MAC
 *
 *	This driver. It interfaces with device drivers and provides abstractions
 *	that the rest of the system consumes. All data links -- things managed
 *	with dladm(8), are accessed through MAC.
 *
 * GLDv3 DEVICE DRIVER
 *
 *	A GLDv3 device driver refers to a driver, both for pseudo-devices and
 *	real devices, which implement the GLDv3 driver API. Common examples of
 *	these are igb and ixgbe, which are drivers for various Intel networking
 *	cards. These devices may or may not have various features, such as
 *	hardware rings and checksum offloading. For MAC, a GLDv3 device is the
 *	final point for the transmission of a packet and the starting point for
 *	the receipt of a packet.
 *
 * FLOWS
 *
 *	At a high level, a flow refers to a series of packets that are related.
 *	Often times the term is used in the context of TCP to indicate a unique
 *	TCP connection and the traffic over it. However, a flow can exist at
 *	other levels of the system as well. MAC has a notion of a default flow
 *	which is used for all unicast traffic addressed to the address of a MAC
 *	device. For example, when a VNIC is created, a default flow is created
 *	for the VNIC's MAC address. In addition, flows are created for broadcast
 *	groups and a user may create a flow with flowadm(8).
 *
 *	Each flow has an action associated with it, which determines where MAC
 *	will deliver any matching traffic in the receive path. This action may
 *	be to:
 *
 *	 - _Deliver_: packet chains should be handled by a specified callback.
 *	   Clients can optionally register a mac_resource_cb_t to interact with
 *	   any associated softrings for, e.g., polling.
 *
 *	 - _Drop_: packet chains should be discarded.
 *
 *	 - _Delegate_: packet chains should be routed to the action of another
 *	   flow, that of the most specific DELIVER flow which also matches these
 *	   packets. These should honour the bandwidth and resource mappings of
 *	   the actual matched flow.
 *
 *	When a MAC client is brought up, the default behaviour is to DELIVER via
 *	mac_rx_deliver to a callback set on the client itself via mac_rx_set.
 *	Flows and subflows may have their actions reconfigured by clients at
 *	runtime, and subflows can delegate traffic to use the action and client
 *	polling contract of the most specific parent flow present.
 *
 * CLASSIFICATION
 *
 *	Classification refers to the notion of identifying an incoming frame
 *	based on its destination address and optionally its source addresses and
 *	doing different processing based on that information. Classification can
 *	be done in both hardware and software. In general, we usually only
 *	classify based on the layer two destination, eg. for Ethernet, the
 *	destination MAC address.
 *
 *	The system also will do classification based on layer three and layer
 *	four properties. This is used to support things like flowadm(8), which
 *	allows setting QoS and other properties on a per-flow basis.
 *
 * RING
 *
 *	Conceptually, a ring represents a series of framed messages, often in a
 *	contiguous chunk of memory that acts as a circular buffer. Rings come in
 *	a couple of forms. Generally they are either a hardware construct (hw
 *	ring) or they are a software construct (sw ring) maintained by MAC.
 *
 * HW RING
 *
 *	A hardware ring is a set of resources provided by a GLDv3 device driver
 *	(even if it is a pseudo-device). A hardware ring comes in two different
 *	forms: receive (rx) rings and transmit (tx) rings. An rx hw ring is
 *	something that has a unique DMA (direct memory access) region and
 *	generally supports some form of classification (though it isn't always
 *	used), as well as a means of generating an interrupt specific to that
 *	ring. For example, the device may generate a specific MSI-X for a PCI
 *	express device. A tx ring is similar, except that it is dedicated to
 *	transmission. It may also be a vector for enabling features such as VLAN
 *	tagging and large transmit offloading. It usually has its own dedicated
 *	interrupts for transmit being completed.
 *
 * SW RING
 *
 *	A software ring is a construction of MAC. It represents the same thing
 *	that a hardware ring generally does, a collection of frames. However,
 *	instead of being in a contiguous ring of memory, they're instead linked
 *	by using the mblk_t's b_next pointer. Each frame may itself be multiple
 *	mblk_t's linked together by the b_cont pointer. A software ring always
 *	represents a collection of classified packets; however, it varies as to
 *	whether it uses only layer two information, or a combination of that and
 *	additional layer three and layer four data.
 *
 * FANOUT
 *
 *	Fanout is the idea of spreading out the load of processing frames based
 *	on the source and destination information contained in the layer two,
 *	three, and four headers, such that the data can then be processed in
 *	parallel using multiple hardware threads.
 *
 *	A fanout algorithm hashes the headers and uses that to place different
 *	flows into a bucket. The most important thing is that packets that are
 *	in the same flow end up in the same bucket. If they do not, performance
 *	can be adversely affected. Consider the case of TCP.  TCP severely
 *	penalizes a connection if the data arrives out of order. If a given flow
 *	is processed on different CPUs, then the data will appear out of order,
 *	hence the invariant that fanout always hash a given flow to the same
 *	bucket and thus get processed on the same CPU.
 *
 * RECEIVE SIDE SCALING (RSS)
 *
 *
 *	Receive side scaling is a term that isn't common in illumos, but is used
 *	by vendors and was popularized by Microsoft. It refers to the idea of
 *	spreading the incoming receive load out across multiple interrupts which
 *	can be directed to different CPUs. This allows a device to leverage
 *	hardware rings even when it doesn't support hardware classification. The
 *	hardware uses an algorithm to perform fanout that ensures the flow
 *	invariant is maintained.
 *
 * SOFT RING SET
 *
 *	A soft ring set, commonly abbreviated SRS, is the combination of a
 *	packet queue with a collection of rings, and is used for both
 *	transmitting and receiving. It is maintained in the structure
 *	mac_soft_ring_set_t. A soft ring set is usually associated with flows,
 *	and coordinates both the use of hardware and software rings. Because the
 *	use of hardware rings can change as devices such as VNICs come and go,
 *	we always ensure that the set has software classification rules that
 *	correspond to the hardware classification rules from rings.
 *
 *	Soft ring sets are also used for the enforcement of various QoS
 *	properties. For example, if a bandwidth limit has been placed on a
 *	specific flow or device, then that will be enforced by the soft ring
 *	set.
 *
 *	A soft ring set can be one of three kinds, depending on its role in
 *	processing traffic in response to classification.
 *
 *	_Complete_: The SRS belongs to the classifier for a MAC client; either
 *		the client's software classifier, or it is associated with rings
 *		on the device itself. These are visible on flow_entry_t structs.
 *		In the receive case the SRS has a thread for polling the device
 *		during periods of high load, and each ring maps to a thread
 *		which performs the flow's assigned callback on matched packets.
 *		In the transmit case, each ring is a Tx ring provided by the
 *		hardware.
 *	_Logical_: The SRS is reached by classification against a flowtree in
 *		the receive path, and its rings are each a thread which performs
 *		the flow's assigned callback on matched packets.
 *	_Forward_: The SRS is again used via flowtree, comprises only a
 *		packet queue and a worker thread, and exists only to withhold
 *		packets of subflows until there is room in any applied bandwidth
 *		controls. These have no softrings.
 *
 *	Logical and forward SRSes appear only in the flowtrees of complete
 *	SRSes, and are said to belong to that complete SRS.
 *
 * SERVICE ATTACHMENT POINT (SAP)
 *
 *	The service attachment point is a DLPI (Data Link Provider Interface)
 *	concept; however, it comes up quite often in MAC. Most MAC devices speak
 *	a protocol that has some notion of different channels or message type
 *	identifiers. For example, Ethernet defines an EtherType which is a part
 *	of the Ethernet header and defines the particular protocol of the data
 *	payload. If the EtherType is set to 0x0800, then it defines that the
 *	contents of that Ethernet frame is IPv4 traffic. For Ethernet, the
 *	EtherType is the SAP.
 *
 *	In DLPI, a given consumer attaches to a specific SAP. In illumos, the ip
 *	and arp drivers attach to the EtherTypes for IPv4, IPv6, and ARP. Using
 *	libdlpi(3LIB) user software can attach to arbitrary SAPs. With the
 *	exception of 802.1Q VLAN tagged traffic, MAC itself does not directly
 *	consume the SAP; however, it uses that information as part of hashing
 *	and it may be used as part of the construction of flows.
 *
 * PRIMARY MAC CLIENT
 *
 *	The primary mac client refers to a mac client whose unicast address
 *	matches the address of the device itself. For example, if the system has
 *	instance of the e1000g driver such as e1000g0, e1000g1, etc., the
 *	primary mac client is the one named after the device itself. VNICs that
 *	are created on top of such devices are not the primary client.
 *
 * TRANSMIT DESCRIPTORS
 *
 *	Transmit descriptors are a resource that most GLDv3 device drivers have.
 *	Generally, a GLDv3 device driver takes a frame that's meant to be output
 *	and puts a copy of it into a region of memory. Each region of memory
 *	usually has an associated descriptor that the device uses to manage
 *	properties of the frames. Devices have a limited number of such
 *	descriptors. They get reclaimed once the device finishes putting the
 *	frame on the wire.
 *
 *	If the driver runs out of transmit descriptors, for example, the OS is
 *	generating more frames than it can put on the wire, then it will return
 *	them back to the MAC layer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------
 * Rings, Classification, and Fanout
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * The heart of MAC is made up of rings, and not those that Elven-kings wear.
 *
 * When receiving a packet, MAC breaks the work into two different phases. The
 * first phase is classification, and then the second phase is generally fanout.
 * When a frame comes in from a GLDv3 Device, MAC needs to determine where that
 * frame should be delivered. If it's a unicast frame (say a normal TCP/IP
 * packet), then it will be delivered to a single MAC client; however, if it's a
 * broadcast or multicast frame, then MAC may need to deliver it to multiple MAC
 * clients. MAC does so by enqueueing the frame in the packet queue of a
 * complete SRS associated with the MAC client's flow. Each MAC client may then
 * have a collection of subflows, and we use a flow tree to determine which SRS
 * (and thus callback, QoS properties, and related) best apply to that packet.
 *
 * On transmit, classification isn't quite as important, but may still be used.
 * Unlike with the receive path, the classification is not used to determine
 * devices that should transmit something, but rather is used for special
 * properties of a flow, e.g., bandwidth limits for a given IP address, device,
 * or connection. This classification also makes use of a flow tree, but only
 * to track statistics and enforce QoS and bandwidth properties.
 *
 * MAC employs a software classifier and leverages hardware classification as
 * well. The software classifier can leverage the full layer two information,
 * source, destination, VLAN, and SAP. If the SAP indicates that IP traffic is
 * being sent, it can classify based on the IP header, and finally, it also
 * knows how to classify based on the local and remote ports of TCP, UDP, and
 * SCTP.
 *
 * Hardware classifiers vary in capability. Generally all hardware classifiers
 * provide the capability to classify based on the destination MAC address. Some
 * hardware has additional filters built in for performing more in-depth
 * classification; however, it often has much more limited resources for these
 * activities as compared to the layer two destination address classification.
 * Today MAC can only request layer two address filtering from the hardware.
 *
 * The modus operandi in MAC is to always ensure that we have software-based
 * capabilities and rules in place and then to supplement that with hardware
 * resources when available. In general, simple layer two classification is
 * sufficient and nothing else is used, unless a specific flow is created with
 * tools such as flowadm(8) or bandwidth limits are set on a device with
 * dladm(8).
 *
 * RINGS AND GROUPS
 *
 * To get into how rings and classification play together, it's first important
 * to understand how hardware devices commonly associate rings and allow them to
 * be programmed. Recall that a hardware ring should be thought of as a DMA
 * buffer and an interrupt resource. Rings are then collected into groups. A
 * group itself has a series of classification rules. One or more MAC addresses
 * are assigned to a group.
 *
 * Hardware devices vary in terms of what capabilities they provide. Sometimes
 * they allow for a dynamic assignment of rings to a group and sometimes they
 * have a static assignment of rings to a group. For example, the ixgbe driver
 * has a static assignment of rings to groups such that every group has exactly
 * one ring and the number of groups is equal to the number of rings.
 *
 * Classification and receive side scaling both come into play with how a device
 * advertises itself to MAC and how MAC uses it. If a device supports layer two
 * classification of frames, then MAC will assign MAC addresses to a group as a
 * form of primary classification. If a single MAC address is assigned to a
 * group, a common case, then MAC will consider packets that come in from rings
 * on that group to be fully classified and will not need to do any software
 * classification unless a specific flow has been created.
 *
 * If a device supports receive side scaling, then it may advertise or support
 * groups with multiple rings. In those cases, then receive side scaling will
 * come into play and MAC will use that as a means of fanning out received
 * frames across multiple CPUs. This can also be combined with groups that
 * support layer two classification.
 *
 * If a device supports dynamic assignments of rings to groups, then MAC will
 * change around the way that rings are assigned to various groups as devices
 * come and go from the system. For example, when a VNIC is created, a new flow
 * will be created for the VNIC's MAC address. If a hardware ring is available,
 * MAC may opt to reassign it from one group to another.
 *
 * ASSIGNMENT OF HARDWARE RINGS
 *
 * This is a bit of a complicated subject that varies depending on the device,
 * the use of aggregations, the special nature of the primary mac client. This
 * section deserves being fleshed out.
 *
 * FLOW TREE CLASSIFICATION
 *
 * The mac layer is responsible for collecting all of the subflows installed
 * on a client into a _flow tree_ of flow_tree_node_t elements. This is rooted
 * in the flow entry of the client itself, which must be of type DELIVER, and
 * provides a structured way of mapping out all paths from least- to
 * most-specific flows for any packet. Any given flow entry may appear multiple
 * times in the flow tree to ensure it is reachable under more broad flows.
 *
 * For every complete SRS we create, we convert the client's flow tree into a
 * *baked* flow tree. This is done by performing a depth first traversal of
 * the flow_tree_node_t s, converting them into a linear sequence of enter and
 * exit nodes allocated together as a single block. Enter nodes correspond to a
 * _match_ against flow criteria, whereas exit nodes correspond to the _action_
 * applied to all applicable traffic. Every baked flow tree has its own logical
 * SRSes created for each node in the client flow tree (typically to share the
 * same CPU bindings as the complete SRS). These vary depending on how the flow
 * is configured:
 *
 * - On an Rx SRS, any _deliver_ flows will have a logical SRS with softrings
 *   configured to perform the desired callback.
 *
 * - On an Rx SRS, any _delegate_ flows without custom CPU or priority bindings
 *   will have a _forward_-type SRS (i.e., no softrings).
 *
 * - On an Rx SRS, any _delegate_ flows with custom CPU or priority bindings
 *   will have a logical SRS with softrings configured to perform the callback
 *   of the closest _deliver_ ancestor.
 *
 * - On a Tx SRS, all flows will have a _forward_-type SRS.
 *
 * _Forward_ SRSes are pre-emptively allocated above to allow for bandwidth
 * constraints to be enabled/disabled without disruption. Tx SRSes never have
 * callbacks, so traffic is only routed down to the device itself subject to
 * bandwidth or related constraints.
 *
 * When a packet chain arrives at a complete SRS, we know that all flow criteria
 * specified by the client have been met. We then walk the flow tree to
 * determine which subflows, if any, should receive any packets instead and
 * under what QoS guarantees. For each layer of the tree, mac extracts a
 * subchain of packets which all match the current flow, and in turn matches
 * those against its own children. When those have been visited, we are left
 * with all packets for which the current flow is the most specific match. In
 * this case we hand the packet chain to the softrings of the node's logical SRS
 * if it is _deliver_, or return those packets one level back up the tree to our
 * parent if we would _delegate_. If no packets match, then we skip ahead to the
 * next sibling node.
 *
 * When bandwidth controls are present in the tree, the delivery semantics
 * change slightly. In this case, we enqueue packets on a matching subflow's
 * logical SRS -- even if it is a _delegate_ flow. The worker thread will then
 * drain the packets appropriately, and deliver metered packets to its own
 * softrings (_deliver_) or to the softrings of an ancestor SRS (_delegate_).
 *
 * FANOUT
 *
 * illumos uses fanout to help spread out the incoming processing load of chains
 * of frames away from a single CPU. If a device supports receive side scaling,
 * then that provides an initial form of fanout; however, what we're concerned
 * with all happens after the context of a given set of frames being classified
 * to a soft ring set.
 *
 * After frames are matched to a soft ring set and account for any potential
 * bandwidth-related accounting, they are hashed out across the soft rings using
 * any flow source/destination fields in a packet. MAC makes the determination
 * of how many soft rings should be present based on parameters such as whether
 * or not it's the primary mac client, whether it's on a 10 GbE or faster
 * device, user controlled dladm(8)/flowadm(8) properties, and the nature of the
 * hardware and the resources that it has. We generally use
 * mac_compute_soft_ring_count() to determine the number of rings. There are
 * other combinations of properties and devices that may send us down other
 * paths, but this is a common starting point. If it's a non-bandwidth enforced
 * device and we're on at least a 10 GbE link, then we'll use eight soft rings
 * per protocol bucket as a starting point.
 *
 * When there is no fanout in the Tx path, MAC does not create any soft rings
 * for a device and the device has frames delivered directly to the MAC client.
 * In the Rx path there is always at least one softring today to enable client
 * polling and related APIs.
 *
 * For each of these rings, we create a mac_soft_ring_t and an associated worker
 * thread. Where possible we bind each of the worker threads to individual CPUs.
 *
 * The other advantage of these software rings is that it allows upper layers to
 * optionally poll on them. For example, TCP can leverage an squeue to poll on
 * the software ring, see squeue.c for more information.
 *
 * DLS BYPASS
 *
 * DLS is the data link services module. It interfaces with DLPI, which is the
 * primary way that other parts of the system such as IP interface with the mac
 * layer. While DLS is traditionally a STREAMS-based interface, it allows for
 * certain modules such as IP to negotiate various more modern interfaces to be
 * used, which are useful for higher performance and allow it to use direct
 * function calls to DLS instead of using STREAMS.
 *
 * TCP or UDP traffic is eligible for what we call the DLS bypass. In those
 * cases, rather than going out mac_rx_deliver() to DLS, DLS instead registers
 * them to go directly via the direct callback registered with DLS, generally
 * ip_input()/ip_input_v6(). mac implements this by reserving flows for these
 * protocol combinations (IPv4 x IPv6 x TCP x UDP), and then updating the
 * callback and mac_resource_cb_t on the flows matching the specified IP
 * version to also enable TCP client polling (see below). Eligible packets
 * (non-fragmented unicast traffic) are then matched to an SRS for each protocol
 * with the correct callback.
 *
 * Whenever DLS asks for such a reconfiguration, we rebuild the flow tree to
 * include all active bypass flows and subflows explicitly installed on the
 * client. Given that we currently have limited ability to self-assemble flows
 * into an effective hierarchy, we combine this with subflows on the MAC client
 * into a tree of the form:
 *
 * +----+                        +----+    +----------+
 * |IPv4|----------------------->|IPv6|--->|<subflows>|---> ...
 * +----+                        +----+    +----------+
 *    |                             |
 *    v                             v
 * +-----+              +-----+    ...
 * | TCP |------------->| UDP |
 * +-----+              +-----+
 *    |                    |
 *    v                    v
 * +----------+         +----------+
 * |<subflows>|---> ... |<subflows>|---> ...
 * +----------+         +----------+
 *
 * This is necessary to ensure that flowadm(8) flows, which then delegate their
 * action, can still avoid traversing DLS. Similarly packets which are not
 * fastpath eligible (fragmented, or not TCP/UDP) will still delegate to the
 * underlying SRS action.
 *
 * HARDWARE RING POLLING
 *
 * GLDv3 devices with hardware rings generally deliver chains of messages
 * (mblk_t chain) during the context of a single interrupt. However, interrupts
 * are not the only way that these devices may be used. As part of implementing
 * ring support, a GLDv3 device driver must have a way to disable the generation
 * of that interrupt and allow for the operating system to poll on that ring.
 *
 * To implement this, every complete Rx SRS has a worker thread and a polling
 * thread. If a sufficient packet rate comes into the system, mac will 'blank'
 * (disable) interrupts on that specific ring and the polling thread will start
 * consuming packets from the hardware device and deliver them to the soft ring
 * set. The worker thread will take over if the system is configured with
 * mac_latency_optimize set to B_FALSE, otherwise the poll thread will handle
 * any software fanout and flowtree classification.
 *
 * Once the rate of packet intake drops down below a certain threshold, then
 * polling on the hardware ring will be quiesced and interrupts will be
 * re-enabled for the given ring. This effectively allows the system to shift
 * how it handles a ring based on its load. At high packet rates, polling on the
 * device as opposed to relying on interrupts can actually reduce overall system
 * load due to the minimization of interrupt activity.
 *
 * Note the importance of each ring having its own interrupt source. The whole
 * idea here is that we do not disable interrupts on the device as a whole, but
 * rather each ring can be independently toggled.
 *
 * SOFT RING POLLING
 *
 * Once packets are fully classified and fanned out to a given soft ring in the
 * receive path, ordinarily they will be handed to the equivalent flow callback
 * by the soft ring worker, or handled inline if there are no other packets.
 * Softrings expose a similar capability to hardware rings: a flow client, if
 * interested, is capable of blanking the softring and exclusively polling for
 * classified packets under periods of high load.
 *
 * A flow action can specify a set of resource callbacks on a flow via
 * mac_resource_cb_t, which mac will call whenever a soft ring is created,
 * destroyed, bound to a given CPU, or undergoes a lifecycle event like
 * quiescence. These give clients like TCP squeue polling the capability to know
 * which queues (and CPUs) any packets arrive on, and can be used to allocate
 * resources and ensure bindings are consistent further up the stack.
 *
 * The mac layer contains several historical comments indicating that SRSes
 * themselves could also be exposed to clients in cases where we have no soft
 * rings. We do not have this capability today.
 *
 * USE OF WORKER THREADS
 *
 * Both the soft ring set and individual soft rings have a worker thread
 * associated with them that may be bound to a specific CPU in the system. Any
 * such assignment will get reassessed as part of dynamic reconfiguration events
 * in the system such as the onlining and offlining of CPUs and the creation of
 * CPU partitions.
 *
 * In many cases, while in an interrupt, we try to deliver a frame all the way
 * through the stack in the context of the interrupt itself. However, if the
 * amount of queued frames has exceeded a threshold, then we instead defer to
 * the worker thread to do this work and signal it. This is particularly useful
 * when you have the soft ring set delivering frames into multiple software
 * rings. If it was only delivering frames into a single software ring then
 * there'd be no need to have another thread take over. However, if it's
 * delivering chains of frames to multiple rings, then it's worthwhile to have
 * the worker for the software ring take over so that the different software
 * rings can be processed in parallel.
 *
 * In a similar fashion to the hardware polling thread, if we don't have a
 * backlog or there's nothing to do, then the worker thread will go back to
 * sleep and frames can be delivered all the way from an interrupt. This
 * behavior is useful as it's designed to minimize latency and the default
 * disposition of MAC is to optimize for latency.
 *
 * MAINTAINING CHAINS
 *
 * Another useful idea that MAC uses is to try and maintain frames in chains for
 * as long as possible. The idea is that all of MAC can handle chains of frames
 * structured as a series of mblk_t structures linked with the b_next pointer.
 * When performing software classification and software fanout, MAC does not
 * simply determine the destination and send the frame along. Instead, in the
 * case of classification, it tries to maintain a chain for as long as possible
 * before passing it along and performing additional processing.
 *
 * In the case of fanout, MAC first determines what the target software ring is
 * for every frame in the original chain and constructs a new chain for each
 * target. MAC then delivers the new chain to each software ring in succession.
 *
 * The whole rationale for doing this is that we want to try and maintain the
 * pipe as much as possible and deliver as many frames through the stack at once
 * that we can, rather than just pushing a single frame through. This can often
 * help bring down latency and allows MAC to get a better sense of the overall
 * activity in the system and properly engage worker threads.
 *
 * --------------------
 * Bandwidth Management
 * --------------------
 *
 * Bandwidth management is something that's built into the soft ring set itself.
 * When bandwidth limits are placed on a flow, a corresponding soft ring set is
 * toggled into bandwidth mode. This changes how we transmit and receive the
 * frames in question. Each bandwidth limit controls how many affected packets
 * can be enqueued without needing to drop traffic (policing), and the rate at
 * which they should be drained from the queue (shaping).
 *
 * Bandwidth shaping is done on a per-tick basis. We translate the user's
 * requested bandwidth from a quantity per-second into a quantity per-tick.
 * The bandwidth counter is reset by either the soft ring set's worker thread or
 * a thread that is doing an inline transmit or receive if they discover that
 * the current tick is in the future from the recorded tick.
 *
 * Whenever we're receiving or transmitting data, we end up leaving most of the
 * work to the soft ring set's worker thread. This forces data inserted into the
 * soft ring set to be effectively serialized and allows us to exhume bandwidth
 * at a reasonable rate. If there is nothing in the soft ring set at the moment
 * and the set has available bandwidth, then it may processed inline.
 * Otherwise, the worker is responsible for taking care of the soft ring set.
 *
 * When subflows are in use, the system may have to account for several
 * bandwidth controls simultaneously given the class of the traffic. During

 * The Receive Data Path
 * ---------------------
 *
 * The following series of ASCII art images breaks apart the way that a frame
 * comes in and is processed in MAC.
 *
 * Part 1 -- Initial frame receipt, SRS classification
 *
 * Here, a frame is received by a GLDv3 driver, generally in the context of an
 * interrupt, and it ends up in mac_rx_common(). A driver calls either mac_rx or
 * mac_rx_ring, depending on whether or not it supports rings and can identify
 * the interrupt as having come from a specific ring. Here we determine whether
 * or not it's fully classified and perform software classification as
 * appropriate. From here, we have identified a complete SRS which this packet
 * should be associated with, and everything goes via the drain function. This
 * will perform bandwidth shaping, and if there are subflows (thus, a flowtree
 * has been created) then this will then determine which subflow's SRS each
 * packet should be routed to. We then leave via fanout or delivery. The subtree
 * drain functions are the most common in practice, since the DLS bypass is
 * implemented using subflows.

 * Part 2 -- Fanout
 *
 * This part is concerned with using software fanout to assign frames to
 * software rings and then deliver them to MAC clients or allow those rings to
 * be polled upon. If there are several softrings in an SRS, then we compute
 * a hash for the packet to choose a softring for delivery. The SRS drain
 * function used above is responsible for ensuring that each packet contains
 * parsed header information for matching -- we reuse this for hashing when
 * fanout is required.

 * Part 3 -- Packet Delivery
 *
 * Here, we go through and deliver the mblk_t chain directly to a given
 * processing function. In a lot of cases this is mac_rx_deliver(). In the case
 * of DLS bypass being used, then instead we end up going ahead and deliver it
 * to the direct callback registered with DLS, generally ip_input. When user
 * flows are configured with a custom action, then we call out to the callback
 * provided in the flow entry. DLS bypass works via this mechanism, but it's
 * useful to explicitly call out the function name here.

 * The Transmit Data Path
 * ----------------------
 *
 * Before we go into the images, it's worth talking about a problem that is a
 * bit different from the receive data path. GLDv3 device drivers have a finite
 * amount of transmit descriptors. When they run out, they return unused frames
 * back to MAC. MAC, at this point has several options about what it will do,
 * which vary based upon the settings that the client uses.
 *
 * When a device runs out of descriptors, the next thing that MAC does is
 * enqueue them off of the soft ring set or a software ring, depending on the
 * configuration of the soft ring set. MAC will enqueue up to a high watermark
 * of mblk_t chains, at which point it will indicate flow control back to the
 * client. Once this condition is reached, any mblk_t chains that were not
 * enqueued will be returned to the caller and they will have to decide what to
 * do with them. There are various flags that control this behavior that a
 * client may pass, which are discussed below.
 *
 * When this condition is hit, MAC also returns a cookie to the client in
 * addition to unconsumed frames. Clients can poll on that cookie and register a
 * callback with MAC to be notified when they are no longer subject to flow
 * control, at which point they may continue to call mac_tx(). This flow control
 * actually manages to work itself all the way up the stack, back through dls,
 * to ip, through the various protocols, and to sockfs.
 *
 * While the behavior described above is the default, this behavior can be
 * modified. There are two alternate modes, described below, which are
 * controlled with flags.
 *
 * DROP MODE
 *
 * This mode is controlled by having the client pass the MAC_DROP_ON_NO_DESC
 * flag. When this is passed, if a device driver runs out of transmit
 * descriptors, then the MAC layer will drop any unsent traffic. The client in
 * this case will never have any frames returned to it.
 *
 * DON'T ENQUEUE
 *
 * This mode is controlled by having the client pass the MAC_TX_NO_ENQUEUE flag.
 * If the MAC_DROP_ON_NO_DESC flag is also passed, it takes precedence. In this
 * mode, when we hit a case where a driver runs out of transmit descriptors,
 * then instead of enqueuing packets in a soft ring set or software ring, we
 * instead return the mblk_t chain back to the caller and immediately put the
 * soft ring set into flow control mode.
 *
 * The following series of ASCII art images describe the transmit data path that
 * MAC clients enter into based on calling into mac_tx(). A soft ring set has a
 * transmission function associated with it. There are seven possible
 * transmission modes, some of which share function entry points. The one that a
 * soft ring set gets depends on properties such as whether there are
 * transmission rings for fanout, whether the device involves aggregations,
 * whether any bandwidth limits exist, etc.

 * [1] The simple case refers to the SRS being configured with the
 * SRS_TX_DEFAULT transmission mode, having a single mblk_t (not a chain), there
 * being only a single active client, and not having a backlog in the srs.
 *
 *
 * Part 2 -- The SRS transmission functions
 *
 * This part is a bit more complicated. The different transmission paths often
 * leverage one another. In this case, we'll draw out the more common ones
 * before the parts that depend upon them. Here, we're going to start with the
 * workings of mac_tx_send() a common function that most of the others end up
 * calling.

 * Packet Metadata in MAC
 * ----------------------
 *
 * MAC aims to support the plumbing of various kinds of packet offloads, such as
 * hardware checksum offloading and large segment offloads. MAC providers
 * (device drivers) often need to explicitly use the offsets and types of each
 * header in play to program a device to provide this functionality. These can
 * often be easily parsed. Tunnel-aware offloads (e.g., those targeting an inner
 * frame) cannot do so. Though protocols like Geneve and VXLAN are associated
 * with well-known ports, we need some signalling with upstream clients to know
 * that they are in use at all, or are not bound by a user to another port.
 *
 * One of the mechanisms supporting this functionality is that the leading
 * `mblk_t` of each packet can be used to access the tunnel type, as well as the
 * lengths of these headers if they have been set. This information is stored in
 * the message's backing `dblk_t`, and providers have a consistent API via
 * mac_ether_offload_info to read this info or parse a packet before Tx, if
 * needed. This is a minimally intrusive means of signalling tunnels in use, but
 * also allows MAC clients to prevent drivers from wasting time parsing packets.
 *
 * Aside from MAC providers, this parsing/storage is used today in the Rx and Tx
 * paths for softring handling, fanout, fastpath selection, and offload
 * emulation. This serves to standardise parsing logic.
 *
 * More of the detail around what information we store and how to access it is
 * contained in mac_provider.h (in the block comment attached to
 * mac_ether_offload_flags_t) and in stream.h (packed_meoi_t).
 *
 * FUTURE USAGE
 *
 * None of MAC's clients today (DLS, IP via fastpath) fill in this information
 * on transmit. Doing so would benefit MAC providers by reducing per-packet
 * parse cost for offloaded frames.
 *
 * A caveat in the stack today is that there are currently several places in IP
 * liable to reuse `mblk_t`s, which have not all been audited to ensure that
 * existing packet header information is cleared. ICMP and ARP are known
 * examples. As a result, these clients could end up ultimately transmitting
 * packets which would be dropped/corrupted on Tx by incorrect application of
 * offloads (hardware or emulated). This is most problematic when packets are
 * forwarded between MACs in the loopback path.
 * As a mitigation, there are a few places we currently strip this information
 * before delivery to a client:
 *  - mac_rx_deliver     (up to DLS).
 *  - ip_input_common_v4 (IP via fastpath, TCP/IP via squeue)
 *  - ip_input_common_v6 (IP via fastpath, TCP/IP via squeue)
 * This limits how this information can propagate (only MAC and mac providers
 * can read stored metadata today), even if it would (in theory) be useful to
 * clients in processing packets.
 *
 * Related to this is the idea that we might consider having a successful parse
 * in `mac_ether_offload_info` update the stored metadata. There are some
 * complicating factors here around db_ref usage, as in TCP/IP frames always
 * have a ref count of 2 to simplify retransmits. Since IP could and should fill
 * this out, the main value in doing so would be in the Rx pathway (which is
 * blocked as above).

/*
 * Soft Ring Set (SRS) - The Run time code that deals with
 * dynamic polling from the hardware, bandwidth enforcement,
 * fanout etc.
 *
 * We try to use H/W classification on NIC and assign traffic for
 * a MAC address to a particular Rx ring or ring group. There is a
 * 1-1 mapping between a SRS and a Rx ring. The SRS dynamically
 * switches the underlying Rx ring between interrupt and
 * polling mode and enforces any specified B/W control.
 *
 * There is always a SRS created and tied to each H/W and S/W rule.
 * Whenever we create a H/W rule, we always add the the same rule to
 * S/W classifier and tie a SRS to it.
 *
 * In case a B/W control is specified, it is broken into bytes
 * per ticks and as soon as the quota for a tick is exhausted,
 * the underlying Rx ring is forced into poll mode for remainder of
 * the tick. The SRS poll thread only polls for bytes that are
 * allowed to come in the SRS. We typically let 4x the configured
 * B/W worth of packets to come in the SRS (to prevent unnecessary
 * drops due to bursts) but only process the specified amount.
 *
 * A MAC client (e.g. a VNIC or aggr) can have 1 or more
 * Rx rings (and corresponding SRSs) assigned to it. The SRS
 * in turn can have softrings to do protocol level fanout or
 * softrings to do S/W based fanout or both. In case the NIC
 * has no Rx rings, we do S/W classification to respective SRS.
 * The S/W classification rule is always setup and ready. This
 * allows the MAC layer to reassign Rx rings whenever needed
 * but packets still continue to flow via the default path and
 * getting S/W classified to correct SRS.
 *
 * The SRS's are used on both Tx and Rx side. They use the same
 * data structure but the processing routines have slightly different
 * semantics due to the fact that Rx side needs to do dynamic
 * polling etc.
 *
 * Dynamic Polling Notes
 * =====================
 *
 * Each Soft ring set is capable of switching its Rx ring between
 * interrupt and poll mode and actively 'polls' for packets in
 * poll mode. If the SRS is implementing a B/W limit, it makes
 * sure that only Max allowed packets are pulled in poll mode
 * and goes to poll mode as soon as B/W limit is exceeded. As
 * such, there are no overheads to implement B/W limits.
 *
 * In poll mode, its better to keep the pipeline going where the
 * SRS worker thread keeps processing packets and poll thread
 * keeps bringing more packets (especially if they get to run
 * on different CPUs). This also prevents the overheads associated
 * by excessive signalling (on NUMA machines, this can be
 * pretty devastating). The exception is latency optimized case
 * where worker thread does no work and interrupt and poll thread
 * are allowed to do their own drain.
 *
 * We use the following policy to control Dynamic Polling:
 * 1) We switch to poll mode anytime the processing
 *    thread causes a backlog to build up in SRS and
 *    its associated Soft Rings (sr_poll_pkt_cnt > 0).
 * 2) As long as the backlog stays under the low water
 *    mark (sr_lowat), we poll the H/W for more packets.
 * 3) If the backlog (sr_poll_pkt_cnt) exceeds low
 *    water mark, we stay in poll mode but don't poll
 *    the H/W for more packets.
 * 4) Anytime in polling mode, if we poll the H/W for
 *    packets and find nothing plus we have an existing
 *    backlog (sr_poll_pkt_cnt > 0), we stay in polling
 *    mode but don't poll the H/W for packets anymore
 *    (let the polling thread go to sleep).
 * 5) Once the backlog is relieved (packets are processed)
 *    we reenable polling (by signalling the poll thread)
 *    only when the backlog dips below sr_poll_thres.
 * 6) sr_hiwat is used exclusively when we are not
 *    polling capable and is used to decide when to
 *    drop packets so the SRS queue length doesn't grow
 *    infinitely.
 *
 * NOTE: Also see the block level comment on top of mac_soft_ring.c

 * propagation will eliminate Tx/Rx/Bw logic as appropriate. Packet delivery
 * code should not call this function directly, but should use one of the
 * specialised `mac_*_srs_walk_flowtree*` functions.
 *
 * Returns the number of dropped packets.
 *
 * Packets are classified by walking a list of nodes unrolled by performing
 * a depth-first traversal on the flowtree. Each node in the flowtree creates
 * an entry and exit node in this unrolled (baked) formulation. We have a
 * preallocated packet list for each layer of the tree, to store ongoing
 * classification state.
 *
 * At each entry node, we match every packet belonging to our parent (or root)
 * against the current flow. All matched packets are split out into a separate
 * packet list for the current level of the subtree. Packets which do not match
 * remain in the parent node's packet list (and may be matched by a sibling
 * node of the current one). Each entry node contains the distance to its
 * corresponding exit node at the same depth -- if no packets are matched, we
 * skip to that node to avoid descending the tree further.
 *
 * At each exit node, we are left with the set of packets which we know belong
 * to a given flent -- we will pass these off to the SRS as required.
 *
 * We can determine whether a node is entry/exit based on the type of the
 * previous node, and how we are altering `depth`:
 *
 * - If the skip parameter of an entry node is 1, the next node in the list is
 *   its exit node. Else, it is an entry node at `++depth`.
 *
 * - If we are at an exit node, then `ftex_ascend` implies the next node is
 *   the exit node for our parent (`--depth`). Else, it is the entry node for
 *   our sibling.
 *
 * Tx and Rx differ, in that Tx will never deliver packets to a node/SRS
 * *unless* that node is bandwidth-limited. The main value of the recursive
 * classification for non-BW-limited flows is in pkt/byte stat accumulation.
 *
 * Unlike mac_srs_pick_chain, we apply *one* bandwidth limit at a time to
 * prevent child flows from being given any preferential treatment for packet
 * enqueue. This walk occurs in reverse order to an SRS's own enqueue/dequeue
 * logic. Accordingly, we hold only one BW lock at a time to avoid deadlocking
 * due to a lock ordering violation.

 * There are seven tx modes:

 * 3) Fanout mode (SRS_TX_FANOUT)
 * 4) Bandwdith mode (SRS_TX_BW)
 * 5) Fanout and Bandwidth mode (SRS_TX_BW_FANOUT)
 * 6) aggr Tx mode (SRS_TX_AGGR)
 * 7) aggr Tx bw mode (SRS_TX_BW_AGGR)
 *
 * The tx mode in which an SRS operates is decided in mac_tx_srs_setup()
 * based on the number of Tx rings requested for an SRS and whether
 * bandwidth control is requested or not.
 *
 * The default mode (i.e., no fanout/no bandwidth) is used when the
 * underlying NIC does not have Tx rings or just one Tx ring. In this mode,
 * the SRS acts as a pass-thru. Packets will go directly to mac_tx_send().
 * When the underlying Tx ring runs out of Tx descs, it starts queueing up
 * packets in SRS. When flow-control is relieved, the srs_worker drains
 * the queued packets and informs blocked clients to restart sending
 * packets.
 *
 * In the SRS_TX_SERIALIZE mode, all calls to mac_tx() are serialized. This
 * mode is used when the link has no Tx rings or only one Tx ring.
 *
 * In the SRS_TX_FANOUT mode, packets will be fanned out to multiple
 * Tx rings. Each Tx ring will have a soft ring associated with it.
 * These soft rings will be hung off the Tx SRS. Queueing if it happens
 * due to lack of Tx desc will be in individual soft ring (and not srs)
 * associated with Tx ring.
 *
 * In the TX_BW mode, tx srs will allow packets to go down to Tx ring
 * only if bw is available. Otherwise the packets will be queued in
 * SRS. If fanout to multiple Tx rings is configured, the packets will
 * be fanned out among the soft rings associated with the Tx rings.
 *
 * In SRS_TX_AGGR mode, mac_tx_aggr_mode() routine is called. This routine
 * invokes an aggr function, aggr_find_tx_ring(), to find a pseudo Tx ring
 * belonging to a port on which the packet has to be sent. Aggr will
 * always have a pseudo Tx ring associated with it even when it is an
 * aggregation over a single NIC that has no Tx rings. Even in such a
 * case, the single pseudo Tx ring will have a soft ring associated with
 * it and the soft ring will hang off the SRS.
 *
 * If a bandwidth is specified for an aggr, SRS_TX_BW_AGGR mode is used.
 * In this mode, the bandwidth is first applied on the outgoing packets
 * and later mac_tx_addr_mode() function is called to send the packet out
 * of one of the pseudo Tx rings.
 *
 * Four flags are used in srs_state for indicating flow control
 * conditions : SRS_TX_BLOCKED, SRS_TX_HIWAT, SRS_TX_WAKEUP_CLIENT.
 * SRS_TX_BLOCKED indicates out of Tx descs. SRS expects a wakeup from the
 * driver below.
 * SRS_TX_HIWAT indicates packet count enqueued in Tx SRS exceeded Tx hiwat
 * and flow-control pressure is applied back to clients. The clients expect
 * wakeup when flow-control is relieved.
 * SRS_TX_WAKEUP_CLIENT get set when (flag == MAC_TX_NO_ENQUEUE) and mblk
 * got returned back to client either due to lack of Tx descs or due to bw
 * control reasons. The clients expect a wakeup when condition is relieved.
 *
 * The fourth argument to mac_tx() is the flag. Normally it will be 0 but
 * some clients set the following values too: MAC_DROP_ON_NO_DESC,
 * MAC_TX_NO_ENQUEUE
 * Mac clients that do not want packets to be enqueued in the mac layer set
 * MAC_DROP_ON_NO_DESC value. The packets won't be queued in the Tx SRS or
 * Tx soft rings but instead get dropped when the NIC runs out of desc. The
 * behaviour of this flag is different when the Tx is running in serializer
 * or bandwidth mode. Under these (Serializer, bandwidth) modes, the packet
 * get dropped when Tx high watermark is reached.
 * There are some mac clients like vsw, aggr that want the mblks to be
 * returned back to clients instead of being queued in Tx SRS (or Tx soft
 * rings) under flow-control (i.e., out of desc or exceeding bw limits)
 * conditions. These clients call mac_tx() with MAC_TX_NO_ENQUEUE flag set.
 * In the default and Tx fanout mode, the un-transmitted mblks will be
 * returned back to the clients when the driver runs out of Tx descs.
 * SRS_TX_WAKEUP_CLIENT (or S_RING_WAKEUP_CLIENT) will be set in SRS (or
 * soft ring) so that the clients can be woken up when Tx desc become
 * available. When running in serializer or bandwidth mode mode,
 * SRS_TX_WAKEUP_CLIENT will be set when tx hi-watermark is reached.
