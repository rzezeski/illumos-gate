/*
 * The first-line packet queue hit once packets are received from or
 * transmitted onto a MAC provider. srs_type identifies whether an SRS
 * is transmit or receive, as well as other aspects of how packets should be
 * processed.
 *
 * An SRS may be either _complete_ (!(srs_type & SRST_LOGICAL)), or
 * _logical_ (srs_type & SRST_LOGICAL).
 *
 * Complete SRSes are valid entry points for packets, i.e. an SRS corresponding
 * to a client's flow and thus a ring or the software classifier, and may have
 * the full suite of poll and/or worker threads created and bound to them. If
 * needed, they will have a filled flowtree for packet delivery to any subflows.
 *
 * Logical SRSes serve purely as lists of softrings or a queue ahead of another
 * SRS, with bandwidth control elements if required. Forward SRSes are a subset
 * of logical SRSes, which are responsible only for policing and shaping traffic
 * bound for another SRS due to bandwidth limitations.
 *
 * RX SRS OPERATION
 *
 * Softrings in an Rx SRS are responsible for parallelising the upstack (e.g.,
 * ip) processing of inbound traffic, by fanning out from a single Rx ring or
 * device entrypoint.
 *
 * In the interrupt path, sr_lower_proc is responsible for moving packets into
 * the SRS. Bandwidth adjustment controls whether packets can be enqueued here
 * and the rate at which they are dequeued. Once dequeued, the packets are
 * fanned out across srs_soft_rings according to srs_type, and may switch to
 * polling mode (if poll capable). In poll mode, the poll thread is often
 * expected to perform fanout if the SRS is SRST_LATENCY_OPT.
 *
 * Polling works by turning off interrupts if packets are still queued on any
 * soft ring reachable via a complete SRS once the drain routine finishes. Once
 * the backlog is clear and a poll attempt returns no packets, i.e., the Rx ring
 * doesn't have anything, interrupts are turned back on. For this purpose we
 * keep a separate sr_poll_pkt_cnt counter which tracks the sum of packets
 * present in all the SRSes and softrings reachable from the complete SRS. The
 * counter is incremented when packets are queued in the SRS and decremented
 * once they are fully processed by a client (via sr_func or the soft rings) or
 * dropped due to bandwidth policing. It's important that this decrement occurs
 * after handoff to the client, since this best reflects the rate at which MAC
 * clients are willing/able to process this traffic.
 *
 * TX SRS OPERATION
 *
 * Softrings in a Tx SRS each hold a Tx ring returned from the underlying
 * device. The SRS is responsible for handling traffic from many upstack
 * callers, and fanning it out across these rings using either an optional hint
 * value or computing packets' flow hash. Devices without HW ring capabilities
 * will have no softrings and go straight to the device.
 *
 * The SRS structure acts as a serializer with a worker thread. The Tx SRS's
 * default behaviour is to act as a pass-through and either send straight to the
 * NIC or to a target softring. The queue in a softring/SRS is used when a Tx
 * ring runs out of descriptors, and in the complete/logical SRSes to enforce
 * bandwidth limits.
