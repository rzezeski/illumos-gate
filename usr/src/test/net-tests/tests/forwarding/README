Running
-------

* Create three native zones and start them.

* Edit config/ip_forwarding.config, entering the names of the zones
  you created.

* Run /opt/net-tests/bin/nettest.

Overview
--------

The tests in this directory test the IP forwarding path under several
different variations. All tests require three zones. The tests use
these three zones, along with the simnet driver, to emulate a real IP
forwarding scenario involving multiple hosts. All tests verify that
TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4/IPv6, and fragmented IPv4/IPv6 traffic can cross
the IP forwarding datapath. Each test differs in its emulation of
various hardware offload features (which would typically be presented
by real NICs). The diagrams below gives a visual representation of the
situations we are testing and shows how the test components relate to
each other.

no mac-loopback
---------------

In this configuration we make sure that the packet travels from server
to router via "the wire".

Requirements
------------

* These tests are currently SmartOS specific as they rely on simnet
  extensions only found in illumos-joyent.

* The client and server zones must provide `/usr/bin/socat`. It would
  be nice to use netcat but our native version is missing features
  like connection timeout.

* The user must both create and start the three required zones.

* All three zones should be native zones.

* You must edit the ip_forwarding.config file; providing it with the
  names of the zones you have created.

Files
-----

ip_fowarding

	The main test script; it provides the logic for all the tests
	below. The different test variations are controlled by options
	and it takes the three zones as arguments. This script may be
	run by hand but it's easier to use ip_fwd_suite for that
	purpose.

ip_fwd_suite

	This script runs the various configurations of the IP
	forwarding test suite. You can run the entire suite or just a
	single test via the '-n' option. The "Test Matrix" section
	below gives an overview of all the tests in the suite.

ip_fwd_XXX

	These scripts are mostly here to work around the fact that the
	test-runner cannot pass arguments to individual tests. In
	order to avoid running everything as the "ip_fwd_suite" test,
	we create a file for each configuration. This gives individual
	reporting of each test and steers us clear of tripping the
	timeout. You can also run these scripts by hand like so:

	NET_TESTS=/opt/net-tests /opt/net-tests/tests/forwarding/ip_fwd_001

config/ip_forwarding.config

	This file must be modified to contain the names of the zones
	the user crated for running these tests.

Test Matrix
-----------

This is a breakdown of all the tests in the IP forwarding test suite.
If a given offload is enabled or disable, it is done so for all
interfaces involved in the test.
